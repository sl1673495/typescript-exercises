Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues we will solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    this workshop.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

Run this exercise:

    npm run 0

    - OR -

    yarn -s 0

interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
  occupation: string
}

const users: User[]  = [
  {
    name: "Max Mustermann",
    age: 25,
    occupation: "Chimney sweep",
  },
  {
    name: "Kate MÃ¼ller",
    age: 23,
    occupation: "Astronaut",
  },
]

function logPerson(user: User) {
  console.log(` - ${chalk.green(user.name)}, ${user.age}`)
}

console.log(chalk.yellow("Users:"))
users.forEach(logPerson)
